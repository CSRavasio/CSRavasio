## Hello and welcome!

### About me

- Swiss citizen, living in London, UK
- KCL researcher, UCL PhD, Cantab
- Computer vision / machine learning / medical imaging: see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6I7loBMAAAAJ)
- Open-source work: [oflibpytorch](https://oflibpytorch.readthedocs.io) / [oflibnumpy](https://oflibnumpy.readthedocs.io)

### The longer version

I am employed as a research assistant at King's College London, and successfully defended my PhD thesis at University College London in July '22: "Deep Retinal Optical Flow: From Synthetic Dataset Generation to Framework Creation and Evaluation". I work on optical flow and semantic segmentation deep learning algorithms in the medical imaging domain, especially intraoperative retinal fundus image sequences captured during vitreoretinal surgery procedures, using complex synthetic images with carefully constructed optical flow ground truths as training data.

I have also published an open-source Python package, available on the Python Package Index (PyPI / pip) in two versions, both documented extensively on readthedocs.org: [oflibpytorch](https://oflibpytorch.readthedocs.io) and [oflibnumpy](https://oflibnumpy.readthedocs.io). Oflib is a handy **o**ptical **f**low **lib**rary which provides a structured approach to manipulating, combining, evaluating, applying, and visualising optical flow fields, using either NumPy arrays or PyTorch tensors. The latter version makes use of the most important PyTorch functionalities: batched operations, GPU usage, and differentiability to allow for back-propagation. If you work with optical flow fields, give it a try! `pip install oflibpytorch` (or `pip install oflibnumpy`) is all it takes :smiley:
